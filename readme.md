This is a helper I created to assist me in creating web sites in CodeIgniter faster.
It includes many shortcodes to add stylesheets, images, and javascript files.

Most of the functions in this helper are already taken care of by other CodeIgniter helper files,
but I created it to work with my coding style and to help streamline the process.

To use, just drag helpful_helper.php to application/helpers. Then you can use it by autoloading it in autoload.php ('helpful_helper') or use $this->load->helper('helpful_helper'); You must also load the url helper.
